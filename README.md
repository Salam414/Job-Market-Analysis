**🚀 Job Market Skill Trends Dashboard**

A data-driven compass for navigating the evolving AI and tech job market.

This project was developed during Data Science Summer Sprint Bootcamp to analyze real-world job postings, uncover in-demand skills, and transform data into actionable career insights. Using over 15,000 job listings, we built an interactive dashboard that tracks skill demand, salary trends, job types, and remote work distribution—helping job seekers, educators, and employers make informed decisions.

**🔍 Project Overview**

"What skills are companies actually hiring for — and how can we use data to prove it?"

That’s the question we set out to answer. Job seekers are overwhelmed, and the hiring market is constantly changing. Our goal was to build a dashboard that answers:

What tech skills are most in-demand by experience level?

How is remote work impacting job competition and salaries?

Are degrees still worth it compared to skills?

Which tools are declining, and which are emerging?

**✨ Key Features**

📈 Monthly Job Posting Trends — Hiring surges mapped across months.

🧠 Top Skills by Role Level — Entry, Mid-level, Executive trends.

💼 Top Job Titles — Understand where people are entering and advancing.

🌍 Remote Work Analysis — Salary vs. competition breakdown.

📉 Tool Obsolescence — Tableau vs Python viz libraries.

💸 Salary by Degree and Experience — What really pays?

**🧰 Technologies Used**

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Streamlit (for dashboard interface)

Plotly (interactive visualizations)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (static insights)

Jupyter Notebook (exploratory analysis)

**📂 Dataset**

Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bismasajjad/global-ai-job-market-and-salary-trends-2025

**📊 Insights Discovered**

Python is king. SQL, TensorFlow, and cloud platforms dominate.

Tableau usage is declining. Python viz tools are replacing it.

Remote roles pay equally—but competition is 3x higher.

Skills > Degrees: PhDs earn only 3% more than Master’s holders.

Job cycles align with Q1 and Q3 budget planning.
